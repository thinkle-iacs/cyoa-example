## Task

Build a choose-your-own-adventure website.

## Why Choose Your Own Adventure?

Choose-your-own-adventure books were one of the first forms of hypertext: a kind of text that you read by navigating a series of links rather than reading from start to finish.

For this assignment, you will build a “Choose Your Own Adventure” website as a throwback to the early days of hypertext. Your story will be written in the second-person perspective. Where print books would have had text like, “To walk into the cave, go to page 38,” your website will use links to direct the reader through the story.

For plot, you can do whatever you find entertaining. Some of it may be a bit contrived in order to include all the required components (lists, images, etc.), but as a rule, the more fun you have with these things, the better they turn out.

## A Note on AI

**Important:** While Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Claude.ai can be useful for tasks like this, their results often lack creativity and feel lifeless. **DO NOT** use AI to generate entire webpages for this assignment — this is considered cheating.

However, you **may** use AI to assist with individual elements, but you must credit it wherever applicable. For example, if you asked AI to generate a long menu for a restaurant, you would need to include a comment in your code to credit the AI.

### Example:

If you use an AI prompt like _"Write a menu for a Thai restaurant with 67 options, formatted as an HTML list,"_ include a comment like:

```html
<!-- AI-generated content: menu list created using ChatGPT -->
```

## Required Components

### Elements:

- 8 separate webpages, starting at `index.html`
- Correct use of paragraph tags (`<p>`)
- Correct use of inline formatting tags (`<i>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`)
- Organized file structure
- At least 1 image (`<img>` tag)
- Chapter headings (`<h1>`)
- At least one properly formatted list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`)

### Design:

- Your site should be:
  - Coherent and entertaining
  - Easy to navigate
  - Logically organized
- Your code and file structure should be:
  - Correctly structured
  - Commented wherever you’ve borrowed code or ideas

### Honors Components (in addition to main components):

- At least one table (`<table>`)
- Customize the style of the page by modifying the included stylesheet
- Customize the look and feel of the page to reflect your theme and story choices.
- Include an embedded multimedia element, such as audio, video, etc.
- Create a better "affordance" by customizing the :hover style of links.
- Add an social sharing meta tag so you can control the preview when you share your work.
